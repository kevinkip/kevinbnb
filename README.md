## Description

# What was my motivation?
-I was intrigued with the layout and design of AirBnb's website, and I wanted to emulate it. With the help of CodewithAntonio's tutorial, I was able to make this website look pretty close to the original. 

# Why did I build this project?
- To brush up my skills in NextJS, OAuth, cloudinary and MongoDB, making this website helped me improve them and learn how to integrate them into my future projects.

# What did I learn?
- Always have a plan of approach before coding. It helps to see the big picture while working on the minute details. There are so many npm packages that can help me. react-leaflet is a great tool to have as a map. react-spinners has a variety of loading spinners that add an extra "flair" to the site. Next-cloudinary is a great tool to use to store images. 

## Installation
